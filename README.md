# SocialNetworkGrowth

SocialNetworkGrowth project studies how product organic growth can be modeled with an infection growth approach. We analyze how different parameters affect the spread of a product usage through a network.

This research was done for the IIQ3763-Analysis of Complex Systems (2019-1) course at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile.
